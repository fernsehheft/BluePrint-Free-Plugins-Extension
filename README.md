## Requirements

To get this extension running, you'll need:

* The Pterodactyl Panel with Blueprint support
* Blueprint installed (built for `beta-2026-08`, which requires Node.js 22+)
* PHP 8 or newer
* Outbound network access to:
  * `api.modrinth.com`

---

## Installation (Recommended)

The installation works best with the Blueprint package manager.

---

### 1️⃣ Download the Latest LTS Release

1. Go to this repo’s GitHub Releases page.
2. Download the most recent **LTS** release:
    ```
    modrinthbrowser.blueprint
    ```
    If the download has a version in the filename, you can rename it to the above if you prefer.

---

### 2️⃣ Upload to Your Pterodactyl Directory

Put the `modrinthbrowser.blueprint` file in your Pterodactyl root folder:

```
/var/www/pterodactyl
```

You can upload using SFTP, SCP, your file manager, or (less ideally) FTP.

Example:
```
scp modrinthbrowser.blueprint user@server:/var/www/pterodactyl/
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install the Extension

1. SSH into your server.
2. Run:
    ```
    cd /var/www/pterodactyl
    blueprint -i modrinthbrowser.blueprint
    ```
3. After installing, clear caches and rebuild assets if necessary:
    ```
    php artisan optimize:clear
    php artisan view:clear
    ```
4. If your setup requires it, restart your panel services.

---

## Uninstalling

To remove the extension, run:
```
cd /var/www/pterodactyl
blueprint -remove modrinthbrowser.blueprint
```

Don't forget to clear the cache afterwards:
```
php artisan optimize:clear
```

---

## Updating

3. Upload the new file to `/var/www/pterodactyl`.
4. Install again:
    ```

## How it Works

### Frontend

The panel interface lives here:
```
resources/scripts/components/server/modrinth/ModrinthBrowserContainer.tsx
```
It’s all React + Tailwind, talking to the backend and Modrinth’s API.

### Backend

This is the controller doing the heavy lifting:
```
app/PluginController.php
```
It:
* Checks and validates requests
* Verifies your user/server has the right permissions
* Streams plugin files securely
* Drops them in the correct server folder

### Security

* Enforces `file.create` permission checks.
* Only downloads from trusted hosts (`cdn.modrinth.com`, `api.spiget.org`).
* Sanitizes file names to prevent directory traversal attacks.
* Uses Pterodactyl’s built-in storage APIs.

---

## 🛠️ Developing & Local Testing

To run locally, you can place the extension here:

```
.blueprint/extensions/ModrinthBrowser
```

Then use:

```
blueprint -i modrinthbrowser
```

You’ll get hot reloads for most changes.
